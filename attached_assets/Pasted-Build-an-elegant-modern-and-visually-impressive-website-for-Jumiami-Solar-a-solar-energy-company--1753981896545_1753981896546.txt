Build an elegant, modern, and visually impressive website for Jumiami Solar, a solar energy company based in Lagos, Nigeria. The site should reflect the brand’s mission to “kick out darkness in the environment” and showcase their services (sales, installation, repair, maintenance), product range, and testimonials.

Overall Tone and Feel
Professional and modern while also warm and approachable.

Use the brand colors white, orange, and yellow prominently to reinforce the bright, sun-powered theme.

Plenty of white space to create a clean, uncluttered look.

Subtle animations on scroll (e.g., fade-in, slide-up) to make the site feel dynamic without being distracting.

Sleek typography: Choose modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., Montserrat, Lato) for headings and readable fonts (e.g., Open Sans) for body text.

Responsive layout: Ensure the design adapts beautifully across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
